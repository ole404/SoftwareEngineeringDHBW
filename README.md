# Tannder

## VS Code

To open the project in VS Code open the tannder.code-workspace file. E.g. from command line:

```sh
code ./.vscode/tannder.code-workspace
```

Then install all the recommended extensions. This will enable automated code lints and format on save.

## Linting and formatting

To lint any of `client` or `server` code run `npm run lint`. To format use `npm run format`. However, if you opened the project as VS Code Workspace with the `./.vscode/tannder.code-workspace` file, the code should format on save.
